# 10---OOP-as-it-Should-Be-Concepts-_Programming-Advices_
This repository contains my learning journey and projects from Course 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts from Mohammed Abu Hadhoud's Programming Roadmap.

📚 Topics Covered

Classes and Objects – Creating and using custom types

Access Specifiers / Modifiers – public, private, protected

Properties – Getters and setters for encapsulation

Encapsulation & Abstraction – Hiding implementation details

Constructors & Destructors – Object lifecycle management

Static Members & Methods – Class-level data and behavior

Inheritance – Code reusability and hierarchy design

Polymorphism – Compile-time & runtime method overriding

Friend Classes & Friend Functions – Controlled access between classes

Miscellaneous OOP Features – this pointer usage, organizing code into libraries, class vs. struct comparison

🛠 Projects Implemented

Bank Account Management – Encapsulation, constructors, destructors

Library Management System – Inheritance & polymorphism

Employee Management – Static members & methods

Shape Drawing App – Polymorphism with base and derived classes
